    <h1>Plastic Is Causing Harm In The Ocean</h1>
    
    <p1><strong>Humans use plastic bags, wrapping bags, disposable tableware, plastic bottles, and other plastic products made of polymer compounds for convenience. However, when these plastic products are not properly discarded after use, they are casually discarded in the natural environment, destroying the landscape while also causing serious pollution and threats to the ecosystem and environment. Plastics may not completely decompose and typically take 200 to 500 years to break down into microplastics. The chemical ingredients of the plastic product can be very harmful to the marine ecosystem, humans discharge all types of plastic garbage into rivers, which then enter the ocean with the waterway, killing millions of marine lives. This causes plastic pollution in the oceans, which ultimately results in the terrible deaths of animals. With millions of animals dying every year due to plastic pollution worldwide, wildlife and the environment have become the largest victims. If allowed to continue, it will inexorably result in the death of more marine life, eventually destroy the ecological balance of the ocean. </strong> </p1>
    <h2><strong>People should stop using unnecessary plastic products. Most of the plastic waste in the ocean is a convenient products for human life. But are these really necessary? For example, reusable bags, thermos flasks, these can be perfect replacements for plastic bags and bottles that are used in huge quantities.</strong></h2>
